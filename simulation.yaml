## Define parameters for the network simulation steps : Growth, Stimulation, Post-stimulation, Decay ##
# Growth
growth_time: 500000.0  # growth time (ms)
cicles: 5  # cicles for recording during growth

# Poisson stimulation
stimulation_time: 20000.0
stimulation_cicles: 10  # cicles for recording stimulation

# Post stimulation
post_stimulation_time: 500000.0
post_stimulation_cicles: 50  # cicles for recording post stimulation

# Decay
decay_time: 200000.0
decay_cicles: 4  # cicles for recording after post stimulation period
